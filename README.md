# Dress Me!

## CPSC210 Personal Project

### What will the application do?

The application acts as a Wardrobe tracker, that can keep a record of all the clothing items an individual owns. 
The application keeps information like the *kind* of attire (formal, casual, sportswear, etc.) and colour and creates 
potential outfit or pairing ideas. The application is built to scale upward through the semester where more impressive 
functionality shall be added such as record-keeping for what clothes were recently worn or favourite looks. Other 
functionalities could be an auto-dress feature, that suggests an outfit given some specifications and avoids giving you 
the same outfit over and over.

### Who will use it?

I primarily thought of this app in terms of the average university student. Given that we have a lot of things to keep 
track of, with assignments and social events, It would be useful and **efficient** to have a digital wardrobe that could
help plan what to wear. Researchers have found that when you wear outfits that make you feel good, you perform better on
analytical tasks. And so, this project could be used as an aid to productivity/efficiency for anyone who needs it.

### Why is this project of interest to you?

In the introductory scene of the movie Clueless, the protagonist Cher uses a computer to browse through all the clothes 
in her wardrobe and tries to match pick an outfit. The program can inform her when an outfit isn't *fashionable* and 
even mock pictures of clothes up on a picture of her. This was an idea from 1995, but it stuck with me because of how 
much it made sense. Most people spend a decent amount of time getting ready for the day, which ends up using mental 
resources. Barack Obama has gone on record to say that he’s “trying to pare down decisions” and that he doesn’t want to 
make decisions on trivialities like food and clothing as he has “too many other decisions to make”. I personally don’t 
like spending time planning what I want to wear because I tend to have 5 or 6 deadlines a week, and so I wanted to build
something that could help people like me.



**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to be able to add different clothing items to my digital wardrobe.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the clothing in my wardrobe
- As a user, I want to be able to save all the clothing items to my wardrobe
- As a user, I want to be able to load all the clothing items from a previous save file
- As a user, I want to be able to have multiple save files.
- As a user, I want to be able to name my wardrobe.
- As a user, I want to be able to pick a colour with a visual colour picker
- As a user, I want to be able to visually differentiate the type of clothing in my UI, with the previously selected 
colour.
- As a user, I want to be able to see a splash screen when launching my application

*Other Potential Functionalities to be added*
- See if a set of selected clothes is fashionable using colour harmonies
- Tracking recently worn or in-laundry items
- Showing all the available clothing or Clothing as a List
- Select One or two pieces of clothing and pick a thing to fit it (Uses the scheduling problem/heuristic algorithm)
- Be able to list and filter items in a list view
- Saving a set of clothes as an "Outfit" and add, remove and list them

### A Note on the Visual Inspiration

I wanted my project to be reminiscent of the 90's and early 2000s with a pixel art style layout, and even including
pixelated rectangular buttons like in the movie Clueless. To add to the complete feel of the application, I also
 added a pixel art style splash screen based on the original project! *(See Below)*

### Phase 4: Task 3
Reflect on the design presented in your UML class diagram.  If you had more time to work on the project, is there any refactoring that you would do to improve your design?  If so, describe the changes you would make in point form in this section of your README.md file.  Note that we do not want you to actually perform the refactoring - just identify the changes you would make if you had more time.  Keep in mind that refactoring does not mean adding more features to your application.
