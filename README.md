# Dress Me!

## CPSC210 Personal Project

### What will the application do?

The application acts as a Wardrobe tracker, that can keep a record of all the clothing items an individual owns. 
The application keeps information like the *kind* of attire (formal, casual, sportswear, etc.) and colour and creates 
potential outfit or pairing ideas. The application is built to scale upward through the semester where more impressive 
functionality shall be added such as record-keeping for what clothes were recently worn or favourite looks. Other 
functionalities could be an auto-dress feature, that suggests an outfit given some specifications and avoids giving you 
the same outfit over and over.

### Who will use it?

I primarily thought of this app in terms of the average university student. Given that we have a lot of things to keep 
track of, with assignments and social events, It would be useful and **efficient** to have a digital wardrobe that could
help plan what to wear. Researchers have found that when you wear outfits that make you feel good, you perform better on
analytical tasks. And so, this project could be used as an aid to productivity/efficiency for anyone who needs it.

### Why is this project of interest to you?

In the introductory scene of the movie Clueless, the protagonist Cher uses a computer to browse through all the clothes 
in her wardrobe and tries to match pick an outfit. The program can inform her when an outfit isn't *fashionable* and 
even mock pictures of clothes up on a picture of her. This was an idea from 1995, but it stuck with me because of how 
much it made sense. Most people spend a decent amount of time getting ready for the day, which ends up using mental 
resources. Barack Obama has gone on record to say that he’s “trying to pare down decisions” and that he doesn’t want to 
make decisions on trivialities like food and clothing as he has “too many other decisions to make”. I personally don’t 
like spending time planning what I want to wear because I tend to have 5 or 6 deadlines a week, and so I wanted to build
something that could help people like me.

### A Note on the Visual Inspiration

I wanted my project to be reminiscent of the 90's and early 2000s with a pixel art style layout, and even including
pixelated rectangular buttons like in the movie Clueless. To add to the complete feel of the application, I also
 added a pixel art style splash screen based on the original project! *(See Below)*
